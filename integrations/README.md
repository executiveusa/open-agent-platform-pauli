## Phase 0 External Tool Baseline

- Contract and ownership matrix: `integrations/external-tools-contract.md`
- Security and install policy: `integrations/external-tools-security-policy.md`
- Telemetry schema for integration events: `integrations/external-tools-telemetry-schema.md`

All external tool integrations must align with these three documents before rollout to Core 4 or all 11 repos.
